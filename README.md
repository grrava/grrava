## Hi all 👋

During the day I teach aspiring game developers at [Howest - Digital Arts & Entertainment](www.digitalartsandentertainment.com).

- Among others I teach the course [Programming 4](avadae.github.com/programming4) and [Group Projects](avadae.github.io/game-groupprojects)

During the evening I freelance on all kinds of projects.

- I am the developer of the [Home Poker Tournament Manager](https://hptm.eu)
  - This is a 100% free app, without ads or other monitization!
  - [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V51EHNO6)
- Currently I am contributing to [Time To Wake Up](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2509870/Time_To_Wake_Up/)
