## Hi all ðŸ‘‹

During the day I teach aspiring game developers at [Howest - Digital Arts & Entertainment](www.digitalartsandentertainment.com).

- Among others I teach the course [Programming 4](avadae.github.com/programming4) and [Group Projects](avadae.github.io/game-groupprojects)

During the evening I freelance on all kinds of projects and play poker!

- Mainly I develop the [Home Poker Tournament Manager](hptm.eu) 
- Currently I am contributing to [Time To Wake Up](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2509870/Time_To_Wake_Up/)
